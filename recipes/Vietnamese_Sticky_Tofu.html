      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Press the tofu using a tofu press or place it between two clean tea
          towels, lay it on a plate and put a weight on top. Leave for at least
          30 minutes to drain and firm up before you start cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, peel the ginger by scraping off the skin with a spoon and
          finely grate it. Peel and grate the garlic. Rip the stem from the
          chilli, cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds if you prefer,
          then thinly slice. Finely chop two-thirds of the spring onions. Ribbon
          the remaining spring onions and keep to one side to garnish. Put the
          cornflour in a shallow bowl. Cut the drained tofu into 8 slices and
          roll them evenly in the cornflour to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the frying pan on a medium-high heat. Pour enough vegetable oil
          into the pan to cover the base generously. Heat until a wooden spoon
          dipped into the oil sizzles around the edges. Lay the tofu in the pan
          and fry for 5 to 6 minutes, turning halfway Drain on kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour 1 tablespoon oil into the wok and place over a high heat. Add the
          grated ginger and garlic, the chopped spring onions and the sliced
          chilli. Stir-fry for 90 seconds. Sprinkle over the sugar and stir
          until a syrup forms. Stir in the soy sauce and coconut water. Bring to
          a rolling boil and cook for roughly 15 minutes, until the liquid has
          reduced by two-thirds. Add in the lime juice. Reduce the heat to low
          Heat the rice or cook it following the instructions on the packet.

        <li>
          Put the griddle pan on a high heat Cut the pak choi into quarters Put
          it in a mixing bowl and toss with the sesame oil and salt Lay the pak
          choi on the hot griddle pan, cut-side down, and cook until they get
          black char lines Transfer to plates Place the slices of prepared tofu
          in the wok, one by one, and toss carefully so they are well covered in
          the sticky sauce Divide the rice between plates Top with the sticky
          tofu Drizzle over any leftover sauce Garnish with reserved spring
          onions and sesame seeds Serve with the chargrilled pak choi
